# Tableau Story: Customer Profitability & Discount Impact

## Objective
This interactive Tableau story was built for business stakeholders at a fictional retail company, seeking to understand **how discounting affects customer profitability** and to identify **top-performing vs underperforming customers**.

The dashboard explores:
- Net profit contribution by customer
- Average discount vs profit margin impact
- High-level KPIs across all customers

---

## Audience
This report was designed for **non-technical stakeholders** (e.g., sales execs, finance managers), emphasizing **clarity**, **color signaling**, and **interactive filtering**.

---

## Key Design Choices

1. **Color-coded Profit Ratio**  
   Red for negative, blue for positive - immediate visual cue for decision makers.

2. **Customer-level Filtering with Actions**  
   Allows stakeholders to zoom in on a single customer and track how their discount behavior impacts profit.

3. **KPI Cards for Executive Snapshot**  
   Total Profit, Avg. Discount, and Avg. Profit Ratio provided upfront for decision-making speed.

## Insights


| Insight                                                                      | Evidence                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌ **High discounts don't always yield profit**                               | Top 3 customers with avg. discounts > 45% (e.g., Thais Sissman at 70%) still generated **low or even negative** profit margins |
| ❗ **Several customers with discounts are unprofitable**                      | Customers like Tom Prescott and Anthony Garverick received 46%+ discounts yet caused **significant losses** (red bars)         |
| 🟦 **Total Profit = \$286,347.00**                                           | It's mostly driven by **non-discounted sales**                     |
| ⚖️ **Total Profit With Discount: –\$27,713 vs. Without Discount: \$311,958** | Discounts are reducing actual net profit rather than boosting revenue volume                    |
